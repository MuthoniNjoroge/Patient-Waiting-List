# Patient-Waiting-List
## Introduction
This is my first Power BI data analysis project, Did it as an introduction to the Power BI platform, intending to know the workings of the Power BI Query, Model, and visualization.
### Problem Statement
1. Tracking the current status of the patient waiting List.
2. Analyze the historical monthly trend of the waiting list in inpatient and outpatient categories.
3. Detailed specialty level and age profile analysis.

### Data Sourcing and Transformation
Got the data in different CSV files for the inpatient and outpatient, worked on combining them into one. 
The image below shows inpatient and outpatient tables are hidden and are combined into one table. IE, All Data
